<article class="">
	<h1>Welcome to my GitHub Pages!</h1>

	<p>My interests range from Open Source to Information Security. I am also interested in web development, Cryptocurrencies, and zeitgeist movement.</p>

	<p>Every now and then I'm a light entrepreneuer, mostly helping my heighbors around or then again, because of my background, also do some web-projects, mostly on LAMP- and MERN-stack.</p>

	<p>I'm also a member of the Pirate Party, COSS and EFFI.</p>

	<p>Usually I'm online (or then again, reachable) 24/7, but if I'm not online, I'm probably cruising with longboard.</p>

	<p>Also, I have a great taste of humor, although not everyone gets it, because it's a bit dark and nerdy. Occupational hazards, I guess.</p>

	<p>I'm constantly looking for new IT-projects to help people out and to improve myself and to sharpen my skill set. </p>	
	
	<p>These pages are currently under construction, so please be patient. </p>
