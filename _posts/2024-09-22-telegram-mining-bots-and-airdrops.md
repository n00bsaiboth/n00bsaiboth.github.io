Hi,

We were a bit harsh earlier, when talking about Telegramâ€™s cryptocurrency miners and or -bots, but then again the same rules applies. Use only the bots, that are certified and regogniced by Telegram. You can see this as a blue badge after the name of the bot. Check that there is a community behind it/bot. Then check the user numbers, the more users use the bot, the better.

We sort of lose our marbles, when the Telegram's own built in wallet didn't work in Finland. Gladly, we did discover the [Tonkeeper wallet](https://tonkeeper.com/). Tonkeeper wallet isn't probably the bestest wallet out there, but I like it, because it's easy to use and the UI is quite slick and initiative.

The thing about Telegram's built in wallet was that it didn't work in Finland, it was blocked or restricted and the same thing happened on some cryptocurrency mining bots. You can try to find a work around with it, with VPN.

So what are airdrops? This usually happens, when the token is about to go to the market, so the token is actually becoming a real token/coin. So you can think of these as a free bonus, when you have been working on a single bot.

Beware if the cryptocurrency bot is requiring all sort of things, like invite 100 friends, follow us on Instagram, Facebook and X. It's usually not the worth of effort. So don't go that way.

Many coins and or tokens are about to be launched at the end of the year, so it's not too late to start mining. Keep in mind that there is no easy or free money. For example, I've been mining on Hamster Kombat on a daily basis like 6 months, and I got like 20 euros. So don't expect to get rich fast. But, after you get the tokens and or coins, you can trade them to another one, for example bitcoin or ethereum. I use [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en) for this.

But yes, because it's not too late to start mining and getting the benefits of the airdops. Here is some invitation links to get you started.
