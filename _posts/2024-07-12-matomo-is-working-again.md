Hi,

I noticed about a year ago, that our Matomo service was down, but I was too tired to do anything about it. Probably it was about, that I changed the whole setup, from testi-pannu to openinnovations. Now it should be working. So, here I am, asking you a favor. Can you go and click one of the following links, you can click all of them, if you want.

- [openinnovations](https://openinnovations.io)
- [Jussi Jokinen at arkku.net](http://jussi.jokinen.arkku.net)
- [Jussi jokinen at github.io](https://n00bsaiboth.github.io)
- [Personal blog](https://nextjs-blog-seven-rho-68.vercel.app)

Don't you worry, we don't collect your data or gain anything from this. It's only that I or we want to know that the Matomo is working alright.

I was also planning that I redo the [openinnovations](https://openinnovations.io) website, with some framework, so I can have somesort of dashboard, so I don't need to edit the website, by hand. As you may know me already, it's not going to be Drupal or Wordpress. I like to challenge myself, so probably I'm going with Symfony or Laravel. Symfony might be an overkill, although, I'm more familiar with it, than Laravel.

In the meantime, please check and join to collect some tokens with your smartphone, [couple of more cryptocurrencies and or tokens](https://n00bsaiboth.github.io/2024/06/25/couple-of-more-cryptocurrencies-and-or-tokens.html) and [Pi network is a new competitive and promising cryptocurrency on the market](https://n00bsaiboth.github.io/2024/05/24/pi-network-new-fresh-and-competitive-cryptocurrency-on-the-market.html).
