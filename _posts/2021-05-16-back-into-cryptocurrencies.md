It's been a while since I last have had any interest in cryptocurrencies, but now I'm back. 

Back in the days, I think it has been over 6 years, when cryptocurrencies was one of my hobby. Although, I knew that I was a bit late and already missed a train or two. Back then I was interested in Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin, then again there was no other coins, well Monero and Komodo was starting at the point, where I left off. After that Ethereum came and yet again, I was too late.

Now my curiosity has woken up again, when I heard the news about Dogecoin. I was sure, that I had Dogecoins lying around some where over the internet and I did, also found some Bitcoin and Litecoin, too.

I have few invite links below, so please, feel free to use them.
