Hi,

Most of you might know me/us already from infected-design.net, it was a wordpress site, but times go by and we decided to ditch wordpress. So now we are known as [openinnovations.io](https://openinnovations.io). The website itself is still under construction. 

In the meanwhile or in the meantime, you can follow us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/4X9hDCG6A4) and or via [Slack](https://openinnovations-group.slack.com/archives/C06TDQBDA7P). You can also follow us on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/fi.open.innovations) and see our another [blog](https://nextjs-blog-seven-rho-68.vercel.app/).

Feel free to join and follow us, and for like future work, I'm not doing anything free and I hope that you use channels like, Discord or Slack to contact me, if it's about work.
