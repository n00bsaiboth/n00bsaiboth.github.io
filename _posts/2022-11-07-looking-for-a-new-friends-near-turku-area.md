Due to a change in living situation, I'm looking for new friends to hang out with. So I kinda need new winds in life.

I'm nearly forty years old software developer from Turku and I'm looking for new friends to go out with.

I'm calm and have a great taste of humour.

Like my occupation says, I'm into technology and sitting around with my computer a lot.

At my free time, I like to go out, take a walk or go bicycling. Also listen music and watch movies and of course play videogames.

Feel free to contact me at any time. See contact [info](https://n00bsaiboth.github.io/contact/). I don't use whatsapp, but you can find me on signal.
