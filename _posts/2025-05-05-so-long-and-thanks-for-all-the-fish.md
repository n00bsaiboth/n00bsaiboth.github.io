Now that we updated our main website [openinnovations.io](https://openinnovations.io) to Drupal CMS, we decided to make it headless. So it makes more sense and we don't need to maintain multiple blogs, because we can only have one.

On a future notice, you can find our blog at [blog.openinnovations.io](https://blog.openinnovations.io). Sadly I decided that I'll do it in finnish.
